I created a machine learning model with sklearn, pandas,numpy to calculate the game score of an NFL football game!
my model was successful in predicting scores, which I am happy about! I was able to predict the exact score from the Rams and Raiders game from thursday night football. 
On average my model is off by 3.7 points and one of my models predicts the exact value 15% of the time. I created multiple models and was optimizing towards the bottom
of the commit. Take a look at my code. Thanks for viewing <3
